          <h3>Gemborks</h3>
          <p>
            The gemsbok or gemsbuck (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the
            Oryx genus. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa,
            such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the
            East African oryx as a subspecies. The gemsbok is depicted on the
            coat of arms of Namibia, where the current population of the species
            is estimated at 373,000 individuals. The name "gemsbok" in English
            is derived from Afrikaans gemsbok, which itself is derived from the
            Dutch name of the male chamois, gemsbok. Although some superficial
            similarities in appearance (especially in the facial pattern) are
            noticed, the chamois and the oryx are not closely related.
